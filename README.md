Hi, I am Bob Vandevliet. During my bachelor Industrial Product Design at the HAN in Arnhem, I specialized in plastics and the injection molding technique (see my IPO portfolio website for those projects). In addition to my field, I have a passion for IT, especially web development in which I develop myself continuously. I find everything related to technology interesting and challenging to come up with innovative solutions. I love well-thought-out and carefully designed functional products, from physical industrial products to everything software related. In my spare time I like to play the piano or work on one of my various digital or physical projects.
